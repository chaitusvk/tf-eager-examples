    "\n",
    "Since Keras does not directly manage all of the variables, we can't rely on the Model.fit() method anymore. So we create a training loop using the best practices of Eager execution.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Using tf.data.Dataset() apis to manage the train and test sets\n",
    "- Using Eager metrics (tfe.metrics) to calculate the per iteration loss\n",
    "- Use tfe.Saver() to save the weights of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Loop Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the training phase, we loop over the entire training dataset, compute the gradients, use the Optimizer to apply those gradients and then update our metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generating batches using Dataset API, it is beneficial to use an infinite generator and manage the cutoff points of the inner loop ourselves. Also, preprocessing can be done with .map() functions, which aren't needed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For metrics, it is useful to use tfe.metrics.Accuracy() or tfe.metrics.Mean() to compute the categorical accuracy or mean over the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the test phase, we loop over the test dataset exactly one time. This is ensured by using Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator(). In Eager mode, when you use this, you can loop over the provided iterator just like normal, and it will generate the batches for the entire set exactly once, so no need to bother with clipping off the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving Weights\n",
    "When saving weights of a hybrid model, several important points must be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keras maintains an automatic internal naming scheme. Therefore, when you create 2 models, they **will have different names for the Keras Layers**. Custom Variables are not affected by this thankfully, but this causes an issue when loading weights.\n",
    "    - Since checkpoints depend on the layer names for saving and restoring, creating saving a model (with say subscript `_1` for all layers) and then attempting to restore a second instance of this model (with subscript `_2` for all layers) will throw an Error. The checkpoint cannot find the weights with the layer names (since it stores the layers with name subscript `_1`)\n",
    "    - Easy fix = Use **tf.keras.backend.clear_session()** before restoring and creating the second model. This will reset the name counter to `_1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model weights and custom Variables are built only after the 1st call. \n",
    "    - When training, variables building is done automatically when we pass the batch of training samples so we dont have to worry when saving the model.\n",
    "    - However, when we create a second model to restore, the weights are not yet built. We need to pass a dummy batch to force the model to finish building all of its weights with correct shapes.\n",
    "    - This is also true for Keras models with **only Keras layers/submodels** when in Eager mode. A Keras model with only Keras layers is also not completely built unless you use Model._set_input(dummy_batch) on it or call it with a dummy batch before restoring weights to it.\n",
